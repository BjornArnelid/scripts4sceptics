# Scripts 4 Sceptics
There is nothing wrong with being a sceptic, asking about how we know something or what the proof are should be encouraged!

Scripts 4 Sceptics aims to help explain and prove some of the things most of us takes for granted. 
Everything aims to run locally on the users computer and uses easily accessible and readable data from reliable and verifiable sources. 
The graphics produced should easiy prove or disprove the concept in question.

## Historical Temp
The scientific community have since long concluded that the world is heating up and moved on to other questions. 
However a lot of ordernary people seems to have been left behind still arguing that the world isnt getting hotter at all. 

Historical temp uses public temperature readings from Stockholm, Sweden (provided by www.smhi.se) to draw a graph of yearly average
temperatures. It also provides 5 randomly selected readings that the user could use to veriy the data.

To run historical temp run the following command:
```bash
python3 s4s.py
```
